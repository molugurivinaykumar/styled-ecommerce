## Project Description

**Project Overview:** The project is a responsive and styled e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a homepage, product listing page, and product detail page, along with a shopping cart and checkout functionality.

**Objective & Business Scope:** The objective of this project is to provide a fully functional and visually appealing e-commerce website that can be used by small to medium-sized businesses to showcase and sell their products online. The website is designed to be easy to navigate, provide a seamless shopping experience, and facilitate secure transactions for customers.

**Narrative of Key Steps:** The project started with the creation of a wireframe design for the website layout and functionality. The HTML and CSS were then used to create the website structure and styling, respectively. The homepage includes a header and footer section, a banner slider, and a featured products section. The product listing page displays all available products in a grid format with their images, titles, and prices.

The product detail page includes a larger product image, a description, and an option to add the product to the shopping cart. The shopping cart is implemented using JavaScript and allows customers to add and remove products, as well as adjust the quantity of each product. The checkout process involves collecting the customer's information, displaying the order summary, and processing the payment through a third-party payment gateway.

Throughout the project, best practices were followed for web development, including the use of responsive design, semantic HTML, and proper code commenting. The website was also tested extensively for cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness. Finally, the website was deployed using GitHub Pages to make it accessible to the public.
